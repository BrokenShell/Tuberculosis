# Tuberculosis Classification

**The objective of this task is to develop a machine learning pipeline that leverages the provided dataset for tuberculosis classification.**

1. Exploratory Data Analysis:
    - Explore the dataset.
    - Analyze the metadata for potential biases (e.g., age or gender distribution in PTB-positive vs. PTB-negative cases).
    - Visualize a few examples of chest X-rays and corresponding segmentation masks.
2. Data Preparation:
    - Preprocess the images and masks for model input.
    - Handle any missing or incomplete metadata.
3. Modeling:
    - Classification Task: Predict PTB-positive vs. PTB-negative labels.
    - (Optional) Segmentation Task: Train a model to predict lung masks.
4. Evaluation:
    - Measure accuracy, F1 score, or AUC. 
    - You will not be evaluated on the accuracy of your model(s), but rather your approach to the problem.
5. Insights:
    - Provide a brief report on findings, challenges faced, and potential next steps.
